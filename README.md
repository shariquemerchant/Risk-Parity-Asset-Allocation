# Risk Parity Asset Allocation

Risk parity is an asset allocation method which uses the risk to determine the allocation rather than being fully dependent on the returns. The method is based on allocating the assets in a way that each asset contributes to the total risk equally. For a long-term investor, who is not planning to touch his portfolio for a while after investing, his/her portfolio would be more immune to the economic surprises and the risk parity tries to achieve. Risk parity portfolio tries to be resilient to any major economic environment and shocks and generates a steady premium over time.

In this project we tried to convince the investor that the risk parity method performs better than the other methods in term of its sharp ratios. We compared the risk parity method with several other method for different time periods and we also perform a stress test on it to see how the strategy performs in crisis. We created portfolio of stocks depending on its correlation, then we implemented the different asset allocation method and reported the results.
